## What is Flask?
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is often referred to as a microframework because it has minimal dependencies and provides only the essential tools needed to create a web application.

## Why Use Flask?
**Lightweight and Simple** – It provides only the necessary components, making it easy to learn and use.
**Modular and Extensible** – Developers can add extensions as needed (e.g., authentication, database integration).
**Built-in Development Server** – Flask comes with a built-in server that allows for rapid development.
**Supports RESTful API Development** – Ideal for creating APIs for web and mobile applications.
**Jinja2 Templating Engine** – Helps generate dynamic HTML content.
